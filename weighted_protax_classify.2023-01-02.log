FASTQ files to be processed are in /home/bioadmin/Projects/BiDoup_2022/221114_M01108_0115/DerepOut_20221223_123614/
Weighted protax models and reference databases are in /home/bioadmin/Protax/models/clean_dbs_20220318
PROTAX Perl scripts are in /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/RHelperSFB/protaxscripts
Output directory will be AssignOut_16S_20230102_135350

Step 1: Get names of input files

File names are:


There are 0 files to process.

Step 2: Make output directory

Output will be in: ./AssignOut_16S_20230102_135350_16S

Step 3: Run protax on each input file

This may take a while...

This took a total of 0.00 minutes (0.00 hours).

Result files are in ./AssignOut_16S_20230102_135350_16S/sample_name
Classification for each read at each taxonomic level (species, genus, family, order) in files sample_name.w_level_probs
Headers are:
	queryID	taxID	log(probability)	level	taxon
Additionally, the best matching hit (for assigned species/genus where available) found with LAST is appended to sample_name.w_species_probs in sample_name.w_species_probs_sim
Headers are:
	queryID	taxID	log(probability)	level	taxon	bestHit_similarity	bestHit

Have a nice day :-)
